                    I never really thought about social identities before coming to UCLA. Perhaps I just accepted them as a normal part of life, and don’t want to think deeper and challenge these social constructs. However, social identities play a very important role in constructing the environment around us. Social identities affect how people treat each other, as well as how we treat ourselves. It is hard to keep ignoring social identity’s effects on us, even in subtle and unnoticeable ways. Social identities divide us and bring us together at the same time. They create privileges that cause discrimination between certain groups of people, while also bringing together people with the same identities. However, in most cases, discrimination caused by social identities such as race, ethnicity, and gender is more detrimental than the positivity brought by the community they build. This is often a result caused by the prejudice of different social groups and their manipulation of the social constructs which create stereotypes, discrimination, and oppression. Changing the way we embrace social identities is essential in breaking the negative cycle of generating discrimination. This is the reason why diversity is important to create equality and equity. Combating prejudice leads to the importance of developing self-authorship. Self-authorship is defined as “an ideology, an internal personal identity, that can coordinate, integrate, act upon, or invent values, beliefs, convictions, generalizations, ideals, abstractions, interpersonal loyalties, and intrapersonal states.” Developing healthy cognitive, interpersonal, and intrapersonal dimensions are essential in upholding just personal beliefs and combating the injustice around us. Open-mindedness is perhaps the most significant quality that one should embrace. Self-authorship encourages the ability to shift to and understand different perspectives based on new information. However, it is also important to strengthen your own personal beliefs in the meantime. Combating discrimination requires one to be mentally capable of communicating his ideals without the need to conform to the opinions of the majority. All in all, social identities are social constructs that generally damage our society based on the prejudicial views derived from them, however, if we can change the way we embrace these identities, using self-authorship, we can build a better, stronger, and more inclusive community for everyone.

                    	I have learned a lot about studying and managing my time efficiently. Before coming to UCLA, I never had any game plan for studying. I usually cram everything before the day of an exam, which oftentimes ended up making me very overwhelmed. I also had really bad study habits, such as only re-reading my notes and re-watching lecture videos instead of learning how to apply the knowledge. After learning various studying and time management strategies during this course, such as the Pomodoro technique, academic self-management, as well as other ways to foster an effective studying environment, I found myself being less stressed and anxious over the course of this quarter. I also saw an improvement in the quality of work that I was able to put out. I learned how to manage my time effectively and spread out works throughout the weeks instead of waiting until the last minute. I also learned how to control the studying environment around me to ensure the most efficient use of my time. Whenever I found myself getting distracted and unable to focus, I knew that it is better to take a break and have a change of scenery than to force myself to keep studying. I also learned how to evaluate my academic performance and how to properly distribute my time to tackle difficult materials. I definitely experienced a lot of growth compared to my high school self. I think the first quarter at UCLA is really eye-opening for me. I was somewhat confident in my abilities before coming to UCLA. However, after meeting a lot of other freshman CS majors and upperclassmen, I learned how little I know so far about the world of computer science. I failed many times when applying to officer positions for various cs organizations. However, these experiences have forged a path for me toward the future. The failures that I have endured guided me toward the better self that I am trying to become. I have learned the necessary tools that I need to learn in order to achieve my goal of being a full-stack software engineer. Failures beat me down so I know how to get up and forge my own path toward success. Currently, I have planned out all the programming languages, frameworks, and libraries that are parts of the skill sets expected from a full-stack developer. I also found many valuable internship opportunities from big tech companies that I know I will be applying for next year. And outside of school, I am working my way toward these important goals that I have set for myself. It is fine to be stupid, but it is wrong to stay that way. I know I am not good enough right now, but soon, I will be enough.
