                    I never really thought about social identities before coming to UCLA. Perhaps I just accepted them as a normal part of life, and don’t want to think deeper and challenge these social constructs. However, social identities play a very important role in constructing the environment around us. Social identities affect how people treat each other, as well as how we treat ourselves. It is hard to keep ignoring social identity’s effects on us, even in subtle and unnoticeable ways. Social identities divide us and bring us together at the same time. They create privileges that cause discrimination between certain groups of people, while also bringing together people with the same identities. However, in most cases, discrimination caused by social identities such as race, ethnicity, and gender is more detrimental than the positivity brought by the community they build. This is often a result caused by the prejudice of different social groups and their manipulation of the social constructs which create stereotypes, discrimination, and oppression. Changing the way we embrace social identities is essential in breaking the negative cycle of generating discrimination. This is the reason why diversity is important to create equality and equity. Combating prejudice leads to the importance of developing self-authorship. Self-authorship is defined as “an ideology, an internal personal identity, that can coordinate, integrate, act upon, or invent values, beliefs, convictions, generalizations, ideals, abstractions, interpersonal loyalties, and intrapersonal states.” Developing healthy cognitive, interpersonal, and intrapersonal dimensions are essential in upholding just personal beliefs and combating the injustice around us. Open-mindedness is perhaps the most significant quality that one should embrace. Self-authorship encourages the ability to shift to and understand different perspectives based on new information. However, it is also important to strengthen your own personal beliefs in the meantime. Combating discrimination requires one to be mentally capable of communicating his ideals without the need to conform to the opinions of the majority. All in all, social identities are social constructs that generally damage our society based on the prejudicial views derived from them, however, if we can change the way we embrace these identities, using self-authorship, we can build a better, stronger, and more inclusive community for everyone.
